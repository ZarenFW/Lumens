Lumens adds 7 tiers of highly configurable solar panels, intended to be used by other modpacks as flexible power generation.

 

NOTE: by itself, this mod is useless. Without tweaking of both recipes and energy generation rates, this mod is likely very overpowered in a pack, and is intended to be properly configured for whatever set of mods you are playing with.

 

Current versions: 1.15.2 and 1.16.4.

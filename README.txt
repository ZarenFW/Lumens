Lumens is a "Mystical Tech" mod, adding a series of solar panels for early-to-late game power generation.

!!CURRENTLY VERY WIP!!

Intended final features - 7 tiers of time- and line-of-sight-based solar panels
                        - full forge energy integration
                        - fluid- and tier-based progression system
                        - numerous ores generating across the overworld, nether and the end 
                        - full ore- and power-generation configurability (including dimension spawning options, to be added post-release)

Lumens is a "Mystical Tech" mod, adding a series of solar panels for early-to-late game power generation.

!!CURRENTLY VERY WIP!!

Intended final features - time- and line-of-sight-based solar panels
                        - full forge energy integration
                        - fluid-based progression system
                        - numerous ores generating across various vanilla dimensions
                        - configurability, allowing recipe editing for energy generation in quest-based packs
